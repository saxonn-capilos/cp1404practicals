# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

I will use panopto search more now that I know that it exists instead of looking up secondary source information
if I don't know how to use a method.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

I need to allocate more time to complete the practicals. With my approach, I need to have a go at doing the 
exercise/task first using what I already know instead of immediately looking at the content for the answers.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I'm applying incremental testing a lot more instead of trying to write a lot of code all at once.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

Stop relying on secondary source information on how to use different methods/functions in python, use panopto more.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

To provide a quiz or do this now activity after every sub topic to immediately apply the knowledge that we learn
instead of just watching concepts being taught for +30 minutes and then trying to apply.
