## About the Repo

This is my repository for all the practical work that I do in my subject CP1404 - Programming II at JCU.
I am a first year Bachelor of Engineering student.

## 3 Lessons I've Learned About "Clean Code"

- To make sure naming class variables comply with PEP8 standards and are clear and understandable.
- To employ the Single Responsibility Principle for every function I code to ensure usability and readabiltiy.
- To write Docstrings and in line comments to clarify the purposes of code.
