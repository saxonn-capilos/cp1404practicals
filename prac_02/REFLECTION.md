# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?

I've watched 100% of the lecture videos.

## What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?

I watch the lecture videos from 9 am - 12 pm (depending on how long the videos 
are) every Friday on the second level of the JCU Cairns Library.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

One thing that I'm doing well in the subject so far that I will keep doing is 
recalling my knowledge from Trimester 1 while also following the PEP standards 
for coding.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to change the fact that I sometimes don't read the practical/do this now 
questions properly and I skip over key bits of information that I need to 
include in my answer, so from now on I will be more careful and analyse the
question/exercise properly. 

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

See answer above.

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

Something that I'm doing really well for practicals in this subject is 
providing the right output for each exercise.
